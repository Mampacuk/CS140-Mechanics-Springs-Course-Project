# CS140B Mechanics
## Project Objective
The project aims at design and simulation of a mechanical converter that converts
binary representation of a number into its value in the decimal numeral system. The device gets
as its input a sequence of bits and generates a spring oscillations the frequency of which
corresponds to the magnitude of the recorded input.
